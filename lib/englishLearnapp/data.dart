      """Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between lush green hills, there lived a wise old farmer named Ramu. Ramu was known throughout the village for his kindness, honesty, and unwavering optimism.
  One summer, a severe drought struck the village, leaving the fields barren and the villagers worried about their livelihoods. Despite the challenging times, Ramu remained hopeful and continued tending to his crops diligently, believing that the rains would eventually come.,
  As the days passed without any sign of rain, the other farmers grew increasingly desperate. Some of them resorted to dishonesty, stealing water from their neighbors' wells in a bid to save their own crops. However, Ramu refused to follow suit, firmly believing that honesty was the best policy.,
  One day, a weary traveler passing through the village stopped by Ramu's farm, seeking shelter from the scorching sun. Ramu welcomed the traveler with open arms, offering him food and water despite the scarcity of resources.,
  Impressed by Ramu's kindness, the traveler revealed himself to be a wandering sage blessed with the power to bring rain. He explained that he had been testing the villagers' integrity and generosity, and Ramu was the only one who had passed with flying colors.,
  Touched by Ramu's honesty and compassion, the sage performed a sacred ritual, and soon dark clouds gathered in the sky. The parched earth soaked up the long-awaited rain, reviving the wilted crops and bringing new life to the village.,
  From that day onward, the villagers learned an invaluable lesson from Ramu's example. They realized that honesty, kindness, and perseverance were the true keys to prosperity, and they lived harmoniously, sharing whatever little they had with each other.,
  And so, the village thrived not only because of the rain that nourished the land but also because of the moral values that guided its people, inspired by the wisdom of the humble farmer, Ramu."""),

      """Mulla Nasiruddin, renowned for his wit and wisdom, was once invited to a lavish feast hosted by a wealthy merchant in the town.
  As Mulla entered the grand banquet hall, he noticed a large table laden with delicious food and exquisite dishes. However, instead of joining the guests at the table, Mulla went straight to a corner and sat on the floor.
  Perplexed by Mulla's behavior, the merchant approached him and asked, 'Mulla, why are you sitting on the floor when there are plenty of empty seats at the table?'
  Mulla smiled and replied, 'Oh dear friend, I was looking for the most comfortable seat in the house, and after careful consideration, I found that the floor suits me best!'
  The merchant and the guests burst into laughter, realizing the subtle message behind Mulla's humorous response.
  Mulla's witty remark reminded everyone present that true comfort and contentment are not found in material possessions or luxurious surroundings, but rather in simplicity and inner peace."""),

      """Another night, Mullah Nasruddin was beating on a drum as though his very life depended on breaking the drum. The neighbors just couldn’t stand the din any longer and went out to investigate.
  “Why are you beating the drum like a madman at this ungodly hour?” a neighbor remonstrated.
  “I’m keeping wild tigers at bay,” Mullah replied.
  “But Mullah,” protested the neighbors, “there are no wild tigers at all within a thousand miles of our village!”
  “Works beautifully, doesn’t it?” Mullah smiled."""),
