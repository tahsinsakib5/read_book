  One day the villagers caught a tiger by setting a trap and placed him inside a cage. They placed the cage by the side of the road for the people to see the wicked tiger who had so far killed many cattle and children by suddenly attacking the villagers.
  The tiger was now in a real problem. He was not given any food nor any drink. He requested each and every passerÂ­by to release him, promising that he would not kill his rescuer. But no one believed the ferocious animal.
  At last, a kind traveler agreed to help the tiger, after the latter promised not to kill him. But as soon as the tiger was released, he wanted to kill the man. The man pleaded for life, reminding the animal of his promise. But the animal did not want to listen to his prayer. He said, "I am hungry, and you are my prey. How can I let you go?"
  Meanwhile, a fox happened to come there. He heard everything from both the parties and said, "I don't believe that such a big tiger could fit in that small cage."
  The tiger said, "Let me show how I was locked in the cage." So saying, he entered the cage. And the sly fox at once closed the door of the cage and went away with the traveler.

  Story("The Fox and the Goat", """
  Once a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, "What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?"

  The sly fox replied, "I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself." Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst, and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.

  Then the fox said, "I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. Iâll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too." The goat was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of the fox and did as the fox said and helped him get out of the well.

  While walking away, the fox said, "Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out."

  Moral: Look before you leap. Do not just blindly walk into anything without thinking.

  In a village, there lived an old farmer with his four sons who were constantly quarreling among themselves. Despite the farmer's efforts to bring them together, they remained divided.

  One day, the farmer fell ill and realized the urgency of uniting his sons. He called them and asked each to bring a few sticks. When they did, he tied the sticks into a bundle and challenged his sons to break it. Despite their best efforts, none could break the bundle.

  Understanding the lesson, the farmer then untied the bundle and gave each son a single stick, which they easily broke. He explained, "Just as the bundle of sticks, when united, was unbreakable, so too are you when you stand together. But if you remain divided like individual sticks, you can be easily broken by anyone."

  Story("The Hare and His Many Friends", """
  In a lush forest, there lived a hare who boasted many friends among the animals. He believed they would come to his aid in times of trouble.

  One day, while being chased by a fierce dog, the hare sought refuge and assistance from his friends. He first encountered his old friend, the bull, and pleaded for help. But the bull, preoccupied with his own concerns, declined, suggesting the hare seek aid elsewhere.

  Undeterred, the hare approached other friends like the horse, buffalo, zebra, and several other strong animals, all of whom refused to assist, citing their own urgent matters.

  With the dog closing in, the hare's desperation grew. Finally, with no other option, he found a nearby hole and sought refuge within. Safe from harm, the dog eventually gave up the chase and departed.

  Reflecting on the ordeal, the hare realized the true value of friendship. He understood that while he had many acquaintances, only a few were true friends who would stand by him in times of need.

  Moral: In times of trouble, one genuine friend is worth more than a multitude of false friends.
