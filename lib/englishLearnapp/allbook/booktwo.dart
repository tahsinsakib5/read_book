  "Fulfilling a Promise",

  Ever since the beginning, the girl’s family members disagreed with her relationship with the boy. They cited differences in family backgrounds, warning her of potential lifelong suffering if she persisted with him. Under this familial pressure, frequent quarrels ensued between the girl and the boy. Despite her love for him, she often found herself angry and frustrated, using him as a target for releasing her emotions. Meanwhile, the boy, not adept with words, silently endured her outbursts.

  Eventually, the boy graduated from university and planned to study abroad. Before leaving, he proposed to the girl, expressing his love and commitment to her despite his shortcomings in expressing himself. He promised to care for her and work tirelessly to win over her family's approval. Overwhelmed with emotion, the girl accepted his proposal.

  With the boy overseas and the girl at home, they maintained their relationship through letters and phone calls. Although separated by distance, their love remained strong. However, tragedy struck one day when the girl was involved in a serious accident. Though she survived, the injury left her mute for the rest of her life.

  Unable to communicate with the boy as before, the girl felt burdened by her condition. She decided to end their relationship, fearing she would only hold him back. Heartbroken, she returned his engagement ring and cut off communication with him. Despite his persistent efforts to reach her, she remained silent, unable to convey her feelings.

  Her father, witnessing her suffering, decided to move to a new place in hopes of helping her start afresh. With time, the girl slowly learned sign language and began to rebuild her life, though the memory of her lost love lingered.

  One day, her best friend informed her that the boy had returned and was searching for her. Afraid of burdening him with her condition, she asked her friend not to reveal her whereabouts. Over a year passed without any news of the boy until one day, her friend brought her a wedding invitation bearing her name.

  Saddened by the news, the girl opened the invitation only to find the boy standing before her. In a language unfamiliar to her, he expressed his dedication and love, having spent the past year learning sign language to communicate with her. Overwhelmed with emotion, the girl finally smiled, realizing that their love had endured despite the trials they faced.

  Moral: Do not run away from problems, as every problem has a solution. Never break someone's heart, as you may not know when you'll need their love and support in return.

  "Having a Best Friend",
  """
  Two friends were walking through the desert when they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other in the face. Hurt but silent, the one who was slapped wrote in the sand, "Today my best friend slapped me in the face."

  They continued their journey until they reached an oasis and decided to take a bath. While bathing, the friend who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and began to drown. His friend quickly saved him from the perilous situation. Grateful for being rescued, the one who was saved wrote on a stone nearby, "Today my best friend saved my life."

  Perplexed, the friend who had both hurt and saved his companion asked, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand. But now, you're writing on a stone. Why?" The other friend replied, "When someone hurts us, we should write it down in the sand, where the winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone, where no wind can ever erase it."

  Moral: The true value in life lies not in the things we possess, but in the people we have by our side.

  "Story of Regret",
  """
  There was a guy who believed in true love and patiently waited for his right girl to appear. Every Christmas, his ex-girlfriend from Vancouver would visit him, hoping to rekindle their romance. To avoid misleading her, he always had a different girlfriend pose as his steady.

  Despite her unrequited feelings, the girl kept returning each Christmas, hoping for a second chance. But the guy, convinced she wasn't the one, cruelly rejected her advances. Three years passed without contact between them.

  On Christmas 1995, he attended a party alone, where friends asked about his past girlfriends, including the Vancouver girl. At the party, he encountered a former pretend girlfriend. She asked if he needed someone to pose as his girlfriend that year. With a sudden realization, he replied that he no longer needed anyone.

  As he left the party, he understood that he had already found his dream girl—the Vancouver girl. The realization hit him hard. He rushed to call her, fearing she had moved on or lost interest. After numerous attempts, he finally got through and confessed his love at midnight.

  Overjoyed, they planned to start anew. But tragedy struck just days before he was to join her in Vancouver—she died in a car accident caused by a drunken driver. Devastated and filled with regret, he cursed fate for taking her away before he could make amends.

  Moral: Cherish the ones you love and the moments you share, for time is uncertain, and regret is a heavy burden to bear.

  "Old Man Love for his Wife",
  """
  One morning, an elderly gentleman visited the hospital to have his stitches removed from his thumb. Upon arrival, he was informed by the nurse that the doctor would be delayed, and it would take over an hour before he could be seen. Despite being in a hurry, the old man patiently waited.

  Sensing his urgency, the nurse decided to evaluate his wounds herself to see if she could expedite the process. To her surprise, she found that the wounds had already healed, sparing the old man from any further wait. She quickly gathered the necessary supplies and began redressing his wound.

  As they conversed, the nurse asked if he had a doctor's appointment elsewhere, noting his apparent haste. The old man responded, revealing that he needed to go to a nursing home to have breakfast with his wife.

  Curious, the nurse inquired about his wife, learning that she had been living in the nursing home for some time and was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 

  Surprised, the nurse questioned, "Would she be concerned if you arrived a bit later?"

  The old man replied, "No, she no longer remembers who I am. She hasn't recognized me in the last five years."

  The nurse, taken aback, asked, "She doesn’t recognize you, yet you still go to have breakfast with her every morning? Why?"

  With a tender smile, the old man responded, "She may not remember me, but I still remember who she is."

  Moral: 
  For someone deeply in love, neither time nor circumstances matter. What truly counts is the unwavering love and care they hold for their partner, even in the face of adversity. Despite the challenges they may face, their commitment to their loved one remains steadfast, demonstrating the enduring power of love and devotion.
